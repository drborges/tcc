\label{sec:objectives}

\begin{description}
  \item[Simplicity] \hfill \\
  Simple though powerful API for processing streams of data based on functional programming building blocks (map, filter, reduce, etc...)
  \item[Robustness] \hfill \\
  Handle the complexity related to the coordination and synchronization of concurrent programs (managing goroutines, communication with channels...)
  \item[Extensibility] \hfill \\
  API should be extensible following the philosophy of bring your own Producer/Transformer/Consumer
  \item[Recoverability] \hfill \\
  Provide reasonable error recovering mechanism: This is important specially when dealing with a great number of concurrent execution threads
  Also relates to the cancellation problem: Make sure the program finishes upon either success or failure releasing resources\ldots
